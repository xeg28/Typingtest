# Typingtest
This personal project is made to practice my ability to program in Java. This program tests the user's typing speed and allows them to use custom text prompts to type. I update the project from time to time to fix any bugs and add more features. 

## Features
* Users can test their typing speed
    * There is a words per minute label that updates during a test
    * The text is highlighted in green if it is typed correctly
    * The text that is not typed correctly is highlighted in red
* Users can test a quote that is not saved locally
* Users can add quotes that are saved locally
    * These quotes can be accessed through the quote list
* This program allows you to create users to track your progress
    * Keeps track of the user's average words per minute
    * Keeps track of the user's maximum words per minute
    * Keeps track of the user's top 5 for all saved quotes
    * Users are saved locally
* This program also has a leaderboard for all saved quotes 
    * This keeps track of the top 5 users for all quotes.
